# Current design decisions

These are current choices and their rationale. Component specifications own exact
rules. Historical D-numbers remain stable references; the complete supersession
chain and original acceptance claims are preserved in [HISTORY](HISTORY.md).
A source rename or documentation cleanup changes neither economics nor authority.

| Original decision(s) | Current choice and reason | Contract owner |
|---|---|---|
| D01–D05, D56–D60 | Rivalt is common clearing with separate maker programs; BTC/ETH, one mint, portfolios and isolated/cross roots; market-attributed accounting replaces the old common-loss group for the current profile | [Accounts](clearing/accounts.md) |
| D06, D29, D62, D77 | Atomic exact-base one/two-maker routes, persistent partial subfills and existing-position TP/SL; current landed financial checks stay authoritative | [Risk/orders](clearing/risk-and-resolution.md), [routing](liquidity/routing.md) |
| D07, D19, D60 | Funded cash versus exact unpaid/fractional claims; zero positive unpaid margin credit, checked fixed-point arithmetic | [Accounting](clearing/accounting.md) |
| D08, D27, D49 | Independent index-derived adverse risk and separate actual-fill prices; no maker quote as risk oracle | [Risk sources](clearing/risk-and-resolution.md) |
| D11, D58 | 2 bps taker/zero provider; 25% of collected fees to originating-market insurance, 75% retained fees with per-market carry | [Accounting](clearing/accounting.md) |
| D57, D59, D60, D64 | Market-attributed losses, explicit funded flat netting, complete shared-debtor/default clearing, greatest rates and conserving terminal rounding; no keeper-selected subset or cross-market reserve sweep | [Resolution](clearing/risk-and-resolution.md) |
| D60, D63 | Own funded exits are atomic account-local health checks; profit payment has a separate complete selected-market certificate | [Accounting](clearing/accounting.md) |
| D69–D72 | Configurable canonical curves, separate reprice/shape/replenish authority, sealed three-maker set and exact bounded best single/pair | [Quoting](liquidity/quoting.md), [routing](liquidity/routing.md) |
| D73–D76 | Old-interval-first causal funding; published depth without hypothetical maker margin; restricted off-chain publisher with bounded signed on-chain checks | [Funding](liquidity/funding.md) |
| D71, D77 | Measure complete wire, v0 <=1,232 / v1 <=4,096, explicit resources and zero priority price, no required lookup table | [Routing](liquidity/routing.md), [interfaces](application/interfaces.md) |
| D39, D77/R094 | Immutable original-signature recovery, authenticated finalized-expiry nonapplication proofs, unknown fees retained, explicit budget handover | [Durability](application/durability.md) |
| D70/D77/R095 | Anchor argument decoding accepts an unused instruction suffix; maker account/quote response lengths remain exact and replay authority remains explicit | [Quoting](liquidity/quoting.md) |
| D13/D16–D18 | Exact installed/locked stack, isolated legacy Anchor conformance, real Surfpool/RPC/WS/PostgreSQL integration; ready stacked PRs | [Operations](operations/README.md) |
| D35/D37/D42/D44 | Change-scoped bounded engineering qualification, earlier focused devnet checks, deferred 24-hour endurance, separate independent-maker/review/funded gates | [Validation](operations/validation.md) |
| D38 | Raw evidence remains local/ignored at its existing paths; concise claims and bounded fixtures in source, no required bundle/upload | [Operations](operations/README.md) |
| D78 | All seven canonical-liquidity PRs integrated at b80bb38; closes bounded M10, no production/external gate | [Status](STATUS.md), [history](HISTORY.md) |

## D79/D80 — approved repository consolidation and maintenance handoff

On 30 October 2026 the user approved the [inspected consolidation plan](REPOSITORY-CONSOLIDATION.md),
then requested a separate final professional README PR after the other work.
P35–P37 cover component documentation, canonical naming and audited legacy
retirement; P38 owns the root README rewrite. P35 repairs root links only.

P35 supersedes the old mandatory phase-by-phase reading list, duplicated milestone/
phase live tables and append-every-run WORKLOG policy. STATUS owns active handoff;
component contracts own current rules; this file records material choices; HISTORY
links the exact old reports and retirement dispositions. PRs carry actual change/
verification details. Raw local evidence remains untouched. A short human README
and detailed reference pages share one normative contract, not divergent agent prose.

P36 preserves current wire discriminators, field order, metas, PDA seeds, error
numbers, signed domains and numeric schema checks while giving current definitions
clear names. Rebuilds change hashes and require fresh scoped evidence. P37 removes
only dependencies proven obsolete and ports applicable independent cases. Do not
reinterpret old financial bytes, unresolved signed originals or deployed accounts
as renamed current state. Compatibility exceptions need a reason and removal condition.

There is no changed fee, risk, loss ownership, insurance, publisher trust or activation
policy. Earlier keep-every-prototype source rules are superseded only for justified
retirement under this plan. Existing remote deployments stay untouched. P15B/P16B
remain Open and endurance Deferred; no external/funded activity is authorized.
