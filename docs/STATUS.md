# Current status

Updated 1 November 2026. This is the live handoff, not a cumulative run diary.

## Baseline and active work

P01–P14, P15A/P16A, P17–P44 and M1–M5b/M7–M12 are integrated within their
recorded engineering scopes. The seven-PR performance stack merged at
**`6b14e8a4447729a6b55d38c22166c60a23083250`**, with the complete tree identical to
reviewed/tested tip `da9966401027a6cb92893db29251a2c696ae0fce`.
[Validation](operations/validation.md) records the exact qualification pins and
limits; [HISTORY](HISTORY.md) records the integration and preceding baselines.

Review means accepted work awaiting integration; Closed requires acceptance plus
integration. The user authorized the performance stack's review fixes and merge on
1 November 2026; all seven PRs independently report MERGED.

## P46 serialized port checkpoint

The user accepted P45's plan on 1 November 2026. Work is on
`implementation/p46-anchor-rc2` above ready PR #63 (`696851e`). No P46 PR or runtime
qualification is claimed yet. The accepted P44 artifacts remain untouched under
`.local/liquidity-execution`; candidate artifacts use `.local/anchor-rc2/candidate`.

Source checkpoint **`10b4d98966ed43b4146f6b77770c2d57bc869b01`** is committed locally.
Delivered: exact RC2 crates/lockfile and isolated CLI;
serialized account/context/CPI port; bounded registry codec; foreign-loader metadata
validation; scoped borrowed event codecs; explicit canonical instruction/maker IDs;
clearing schema/journal binding 8 and maker account schema 5; real generated IDLs/SDK;
independent legacy and RC2 conformance processes. Quote/report versions, economics,
field layouts, seeds and ordered privileges remain unchanged. `state-only` dependency
features resolve an observed RC2 exported-dispatch linker conflict. C0 remains
serialized; no selective zero-copy optimization has been attempted.

Actual checks on this working tree: `cargo test` for clearing with qualification and
maker-interface passes **119 + 12** tests, including new bounded/truncated registry
and loader-header negatives; all default/qualification SBF programs and oracle/
hostile fixtures build with v1.52/SBPF v0 and no unsafe stack diagnostics. The exact
ABI guard passes against immutable predecessor `c0bc3aa`, with reviewed RC2 metadata
exceptions. TypeScript checking and SDK generation pass. Scoped client tests first
reported 18 stale-schema-fixture/decoder failures; affected rerun passes **45/45**,
with the other **200** preceding checks passing. Five scoped conformance tests pass
with both isolated clients. These are current observations, not full qualification.
Local logs are under `.local/anchor-v2-build/`. Clean default/qualification artifacts
are pinned to `10b4d98`. First Surfpool attempt deployed all four programs but the
client correctly rejected its old P44 executable allowlist before financial actions
(`custody-10b4d98`). The candidate allowlist now pins the actual C0 hashes/lengths;
fresh test domains distinguish schema 8. This is an explicit candidate selection,
not an artifact qualification claim.

No signed candidate transaction, actual RPC/WS/PostgreSQL replay, hostile runtime
acceptance, browser/load matrix or B/C cost comparison has passed. Broad regression
is delegated to CI; no hosted result is claimed. P15B/P16B and deferred endurance
are unchanged. No access blocker is present. Next exact action: commit the candidate allowlist and run the explicit
candidate custody probe against fresh Surfpool before route/safety/journal acceptance.

## Accepted performance stack

P39–P44 follow D82 and are now the integrated baseline.
P39's immutable focused A baseline uses SBF `828fe543`; P40A adds durable bounded
service lanes, P40B scoped authenticated history, P41 relevant market dependencies,
and P42 schema-7 token custody/internal-accounting separation. Their exact accepted
commits, fresh RPC/WS/PG results and limits are in
[validation](operations/validation.md). No historical results are relabelled as P44.

P43's accepted uninstrumented SBF source is
`fb5d0c546a417796ce615e0d3d3575545c96c178`; clean verifier `1e86661` supplies its
matched CU comparison, full books and complete safety constituents. Route savings
are 669–1,230 CU; requested limits and actual fees are unchanged. Its four applicable
hosted CI jobs and automated review pass on `f9d29f6` in
[run 41244319044](https://github.com/arnabnandikgp/rivalt/actions/runs/41244319044).
Compiler-size experiments with oversized stack frames remain rejected.

## P44 checkpoint

P44 retains the same programs/IDL/economics and fixes the operational failures
found in qualification: D88 finalized-valid blockhash witnesses; D89 immutable
oldest-conflicting-original dispatch; mandatory UI account-schema forwarding; and
bounded eight-block finalized history retrieval with unchanged ordered application,
complete manifests and exact reconciliation. Old dispatcher version-1 originals
must drain before upgrade; ambiguous fees/reservations are never released to make
progress. Operators use separate restricted maker/publisher fee payers.

The B baseline covers **61/61** public entrypoints across
**2,871** independently fetched harness originals on the exact pinned binaries;
reverted calls cannot establish successful coverage. The operator and browser
populations remain separate. Current source, artifacts, fixtures, scenario maxima,
caller/scaling table, priority-fee assumptions and limitations are recorded in
[performance](operations/performance.md) and
[validation](operations/validation.md#frozen-pre-migration-qualification-p44).

Clean `a5afbc9` completes 239 durable originals (236 success / three report
rejections), three lost-ack/SIGKILL recoveries, stored-order execution, publisher
handover/revocation, source outage/recovery and live indexer restart. Fresh PG replay
matches 137 events over eight members/70 accounts; independent audit verifies
7,999,993 vault atoms, 7,999,968 cash and 25 taker-fee atoms. All six makers remain
internal and hedge costs unobserved. Ten browser actions separately pass at
`f4490e9`, including reload recovery and cash actions with both APIs blocked.

Clean `8b8c33f` completes the current bounded load experiment: 1,008 offers,
465 unique finalized originals, 430 fills, 35 on-chain rejections and
543 unsubmitted offers with explicit generator/duplicate reasons. There are no
expired/unresolved load originals. Live indexing records 2 coherent cycles and
33 revision-ahead retries; final and fresh replay match 585 events and exactly
9,000,000 vault atoms. Earlier 1/28 live progress and duplicate-wire failure remain
recorded, not counted as successful full runs. This is not sustained availability
or validator TPS.

The actual 64-member default, eight scratch-only width cases, five compiled
hostile-maker rollback cases, custody/dependency/treasury/retirement lifecycles,
and their independent financial/replay checks pass at the exact pins in validation.
The 56 added default members are flat; wide fixtures perform no payout. Ordinary
own-cash exits remain independent of unpaid-profit certificates; earlier certificate
pages still require stable relevant observations.

Fourteen affected indexer tests, 31 queue/receipt/cost cases, two independent audit
regressions and typecheck pass. Raw originals, failed attempts and databases stay
local/ignored. No new SBF build, unrelated local native suites, endurance, devnet,
external wallet, funded deployment or Anchor v2 migration is run. Broad supported
regression belongs to CI. The 53,089-byte frozen baseline reproduces from its pinned
originals; typecheck, documentation links, shell syntax, whitespace and the staged
128 KiB aggregate evidence budget pass. Acceptance content is `ade628d`.
All four applicable hosted checks (scope, shell, client and financial) pass on
review fix `da99664` in [run 41280117782](https://github.com/arnabnandikgp/rivalt/actions/runs/41280117782).

The review fix commits the finalized-valid blockhash witness with dispatch
admission, closing a process-death window before status RPC or broadcast. Nineteen
focused queue/dispatch/risk-authority tests and typecheck pass. Fresh actual
RPC/WS/PG qualification at clean `da99664` kills an executor immediately after
admission: witness slot 1522 and seven access rows survive with zero attempts.
Restart after real expiry proves nonexecution, releases access and retains the
20,000-lamport unknown-fee reserve. The run also passes post-send SIGKILL recovery,
SQL fairness/drain cases and identical 61-event fresh replay, with eight members,
70 accounts and 7,999,993 vault atoms. Evidence remains in
`.local/liquidity-execution/runs/p44-review-dispatch/`.

All review threads were resolved before merge. The P43 cross-run comparison claim
was narrowed to its recorded aggregates; service-role CU is explicitly labelled
transaction CU. Automated reviews skipped/rate-limited on #56/#58/#59/#60 and the
latest #62 update are not independent approval. No additional program build,
load/endurance run or external qualification was needed for this queue/docs fix.
The fetched merge has identical tree and includes the tested fix as an ancestor.
No implementation blocker remains within this completed scope.
P45 now uses the frozen B baseline to scope the separately requested RC2 migration;
the active planning checkpoint above owns the next action. Implementation has not
started.

## Deployment and operational limits

Current trading is qualified only in its explicit bounded local profile; default/
devnet stay gated. Synthetic sources, internal makers and a local demo wallet do
not establish independent or production readiness. Restricted publisher trust,
finite two-market/three-maker bounds, retained unknown-fee reservations and
coordinated unpaid-profit certificates remain explicit. Historical latency results
are not new P37 measurements. See [deployment](operations/deployment.md) and
[validation](operations/validation.md). No funded pilot, paid service, outreach or
external hedge is authorized by consolidation.
